## Aim of the course

We are ecologists and statisticians in Norway that want to increase the awareness of Open Science principles in our community and provide education and teaching material on open science, reproducibility and transparency in ecology.

-   We organize courses and workshops on Open Science for ecologists.

-   We provide the teaching material that we use in the Open Science course and other courses openly available.

-   We develop tools to facilitate Open Science practices in our community.
